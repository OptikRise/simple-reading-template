# Overview
I work in the curriculum development side. Most of our web content requests come from Instructional Designers. For a long time, they were requesting web pages to be created from Word documents. Very simple informational pages. We were hand coding these outside of a CMS (like WordPress) pretty regularly. We wanted to be able to track them all, house them in one place, and find an easier way to make them uniform. Hence, a very simple template in WordPress was born where anyone who was available on our team could code/create this in WordPress.

The work I do is owned by my current employer so this version of the site and code has been altered to hide proprietary information.

## Screenshots
Here's what the template looks like live. Again, using Lorem Ipsum to protect my employer's content.
